Feature: View materials per employee

As a client, I want to create a POJO from the source.xml and expected_target.xml files, and the data should be mapped from source.xml to expected_target.xml by looking at the mapping_with_validation.csv file, and create a collection in mongoDB if not exist as a test, and create a document of the source data 

[^expected_target.xml]

[^source.xml] [^mapping_with_validation.csv]  GitHub-URL: [https://github.com/msn5566/SDLCAutonomus|https://github.com/msn5566/SDLCAutonomus|smart-link]
