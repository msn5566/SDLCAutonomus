# AI Build Failure Analysis

The AI-generated code failed the build verification step. Here is the analysis from the Review Agent:

---

The build failed due to a test failure in `DataMappingServiceImplTest.java`. The specific error message "Wanted but not invoked: sourceDataRepository.save(<any com.msn.SDLCAutonomus.model.SourceData>)" indicates that a mock object `sourceDataRepository` was expected to have its `save` method called during the test `testSaveSourceData`, but it wasn't. This typically means that the code under test, `DataMappingServiceImpl`, is not correctly calling the `save` method on the `sourceDataRepository` when it should.

The solution is to examine the `DataMappingServiceImpl.java` and ensure the `save` method is being called on the injected `sourceDataRepository` in the relevant logic. There might be a conditional statement preventing the save, or an incorrect data mapping preventing the save operation.
