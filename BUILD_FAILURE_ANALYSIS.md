# AI Build Failure Analysis

The AI-generated code failed the build verification step. Here is the analysis from the Review Agent:

---

The build failed due to test failures.
Specifically, the `DataServiceImplTest` shows failures indicating that `mongoTemplate.collectionExists()` was never invoked during the tests `processData_collectionDoesNotExist` and `processData_success`.
This suggests that the mocking setup for `mongoTemplate` in these tests is not correctly interacting with the `DataServiceImpl`'s code.
Likely cause is an incorrect `@Mock` or `@InjectMocks` annotation, or the mocked object is not correctly injected. Review the test setup to ensure `mongoTemplate` is properly mocked and injected into `DataServiceImpl` during the tests. Check if the method `collectionExists` is actually called within the service logic under test. Also, check if the argument matchers are too strict, preventing the mock from being called.
